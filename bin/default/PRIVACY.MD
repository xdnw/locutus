1. Locutus will not store data that is not necessary for the operation of the service or the future operation of the service. For example, log data, generated data (tickets, embassies, etc), and Discord settings (channels, roles, etc) are stored only to provide the service.
2. All data will be deleted when it is no longer provided to provide the service or Locutus no longer has access to the data (for example, with Discord settings).
3. To request data deletion, please contact @borg#5729 (664156861033086987) on Discord, open a ticket on the support server, or email jessepaleg@gmail.com
4. This policy may be changed at any time.
